    <P>Manmohan Singh (Punjabi: [mənˈmoːɦən ˈsɪ́ŋɡ] ⓘ; 26 September 1932 – 26 December 2024) was an Indian politician,
        economist, academic, and bureaucrat, who served as the 13th prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He was
        the fourth longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi.[1] A member
        of the Indian National Congress, Singh was the first Sikh prime minister of India.[2] He was also the first
        prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term.[3][4]

        Born in Gah in what is today Pakistan, Singh's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After
        obtaining his doctorate in economics from Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966–1969. He
        subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of
        Commerce and Industry. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the Government of India, such
        as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of the Planning
        Commission (1985–1987).

        In 1991, as India faced a severe economic crisis, the newly elected prime minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao,
        inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as finance minister. Over the next few years, despite strong
        opposition, he carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India's economy. Although these measures
        proved successful in averting the crisis, and enhanced Singh's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded
        economist, the incumbent Congress Party fared poorly in the 1996 general election. Subsequently, Singh was
        leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) during the Atal Bihari
        Vajpayee government of 1998–2004.

        In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi
        unexpectedly relinquished the prime ministership to Singh. His first ministry executed several key legislations
        and projects, including the National Rural Health Mission, Unique Identification Authority, Rural Employment
        Guarantee scheme and Right to Information Act. In 2008, opposition to a historic civil nuclear agreement with
        the United States nearly caused Singh's government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support.[5]
        In 2009, he co-founded the BRICS.[6] India's economy grew rapidly during his term.[7][8]</P>
